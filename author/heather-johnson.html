                    <p>It is the weekend before my last semester of my undergraduate career at George Mason University and I am kind of freaking out. I have no job propositions at the moment; nonetheless, I have faith that I will be fine. To reassure myself I decided I wanted to bake, so I went with a favorite: banana bread. Growing up I always made my grandma's banana bread. This time I decided to stay safe and make the same recipe. There is just something about this type of banana bread that I enjoy more than others. Here is the recipe:</p>
<p>1 1/4 cup sugar<br />
1 1/4 cup flour<br />
1/2 tsp. salt<br />
1 tsp. baking soda</p>
<p>Mix the dry ingredients and then continue to the wet ingredients.</p>
<p>1/2 cup butter<br />
2 eggs<br />
3 very ripe bananas</p>
<p>Mix together with beaters until smooth. Then in a large bowl, mix both wet and dry ingredients together in a non-metallic bowl with a wooden spoon and bake at 350 degress for 50-60 minutes.</p>

                    <p>I recently saw my cousin, Caitlin. She and I have always been best friends even when we don't see each other or talk as often as we would like. This year we are both in our senior year in college. She is a harpist in Oberlin, a music conservatory, and has a senior recital she will be playing in May.</p>
<p>Over the past two years, I have been learning how to bake and decorate cakes. Unfortunately, I am not the best at making flowers out of gumpaste. One of my good friends in college, now my cake mentor, taught me how to make roses. I have now frozen them to keep them until needed. This is the first step in a beautiful cake for one of my most favorite of people.</p>

                    <p>My boyfriend, Kunal, and I made a spinach and feta braided loaf and a cheesy bread with mushrooms, onions, red peppers, zucchini, and crumbled Italian style chicken.</p>

                    <p>My boyfriend, Kunal, found <a href="https://userexpectations.wordpress.com/2014/12/17/crowd-pleaser-mediterranean-crescent-wreath/">the recipe</a> for the Mediterranean Wreath while exploring Reddit. I have made it a couple times now for both New Years and for a party with my mother's church group, and each time it has been a hit! It is very easy to make and just as simple to make look good! I definitely reccomend to anyone who might want to try it.
Here is how mine turned out &mdash;</p>
